## R package to automate generation of procedure books

**Context: How to do this thing that only your colleague do when he's not here ?** 

This project contain a little framework to list procedures in a structured way that can be shared with all colleagues.
   
The YAML file contains all procedures and is versionable as a simple text file containing data : procedures or here soup recipes.
  
This file contains a list of soup recipes in the form of a YAML file. 
  
This is an example for a more procedure dictionnary oriented documentation.

When there are many procedures or recipes, you can use the search tool of bookdown to find the one you need more easily.

Adding new procedure is relatively easy thanks to YAML file structure.

## Idea

Using a YAML file and bookdown R package to build a book shareable procedure listing like a book.

## Example

- [YAML file](index_procedures.yaml) is an example of listing procedures with some soup recipes and empty shell procedures

The result book is here :
