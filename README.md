## use R, YAML and bookdown to automate generation of procedure books

**Context: How to do this thing that only your colleague does when he's not here ?** 

This project contains a little framework to list procedures in a structured way that can be shared with all colleagues.
   
## Idea

Using a YAML file and bookdown R package to build a shareable procedure listing like a book.

## Example

- [YAML file](index_procedures.yaml) is an example of listing procedures with some soup recipes and empty shell procedures

The result book is here :
